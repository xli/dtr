= DTR Changelog

== release 1.1.0
* Run 'rake db:migrate:reset db:test:prepare' for runner to setup database environment before runner runs any test, when there is 'config/database.yml.dtr' or 'config/database.yml' exists. If './config/database.yml.dtr' specified, it would be copy as ./config/database.yml for setup database. For Sqlite, there is no need to create a './config/database.yml.dtr' for dtr test task. The following is an example for mysql:
    development:
      database: development_<%= ENV['DTR_RUNNER_NAME'] %>
      adapter: mysql
      username: root
      password: 
      host: localhost

    test:
      database: test_<%= ENV['DTR_RUNNER_NAME'] %>
      adapter: mysql
      username: root
      password: 
      host: localhost
