= DTR Project -- To Do List

Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  update help doc
  problem: when agent can't find test files, drb can't undump test object, the error would be: undefined method `run' for #<DRb::DRbUnknown:0x318800>
     * tell Master this error that agent can't know what's item sent from Master
  need test:
    monitor

=== TBD for next release
  should trigger started notification on runner in agent runner, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test)
  agent brain should wakeup when worker is dead, so that it could be picked up by another master process
  prepare one database, and copy the database for runners, so that run tests in multi-processes could be easy setup.
