Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  agent should use master process ip as broadcast
  give sync_codebase/codebase a better name
  master process log doesn't have time label in mingle
  update help doc
  should trigger started notification on runner in agent runner, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test)
  
  ???? agent brain should wakeup when worker is dead
  problem: when agent can't find test files, drb can't undump test object, the error would be: undefined method `run' for #<DRb::DRbUnknown:0x318800>
     * tell Master this error that agent can't know what's item sent from Master
  
  fix problem: start agent -> run tests -> stop agent before test finished -> restart agent -> can't
  
  need test:
    monitor
