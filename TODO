Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  update help doc

=== TBD for next release
  should trigger started notification on test runner in agent Herald, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test) to setup test environment.
  agent should wakeup when worker is dead, so that it could be picked up by another master process
  prepare one database, and copy the database for runners, so that run tests in multi-processes could be easy setup.
  provide a way to monitor agent runner efficiency
