= DTR Project -- To Do List

Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  Add teardown command for agent runners to run after all test finished and before runner quits. This and setup test environment command features provide ability to start & stop selenium proxy server, or start & stop test server.

=== TBD for next release
  should trigger started notification on test runner in agent Herald, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test) to setup test environment.
  agent should wakeup when worker is dead, so that it could be picked up by another master process
