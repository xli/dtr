= DTR Project -- To Do List

Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  auto prepare database for each runner, so that run tests in multi-processes could be easy setup. 
    * test for database.yml.dtr specified
    * test for no database.yml.dtr and database.yml

=== TBD for next release
  should trigger started notification on test runner in agent Herald, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test) to setup test environment.
  agent should wakeup when worker is dead, so that it could be picked up by another master process
  provide a way to monitor agent runner efficiency
  use system instead of fork to launch sub process in agent, which makes dtr support windows and jruby
