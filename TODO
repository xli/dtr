=== To Do
  give sync_codebase/codebase a better name
  master process log doesn't have time label in mingle
  auto mkdir log&tmp for agent? --rails option?
  update help doc
  should trigger started notification on runner in agent runner, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test)
  
  ???? agent brain should wakeup when worker is dead
  problem: when agent can't find test files, drb can't undump test object, the error would be: undefined method `run' for #<DRb::DRbUnknown:0x318800>
     * tell Master this error that agent can't know what's item sent from Master
  
  monitor dtr rinda server status
  monitor acceptance test
  
  fix problem: start agent -> run tests -> stop agent before test finished -> restart agent -> can't
  
  need test:
    monitor
