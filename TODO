= DTR Project -- To Do List

Send suggestions for this list to iam@li-xiao.com

=== To Do
  rails ext test can pass without database.yml.dtr specified
  shouldn't we copy codebase when agent is run in same dir with master process?
  auto prepare database for each runner, so that run tests in multi-processes could be easy setup. 
    for sqlite, we don't need anything specified anything for it, because running in different directory already made test running in different database, so does in-memory mode.
    runner loads 'config/database.yml.dtr' to create, db:migrate and db:test:prepare database
      provide default database.yml.dtr:
        development:
          database: <%= "dtr_development_#{ENV['RUNNER_NAME']}" %>
          adapter: mysql
          username: root
          password: 
          host: localhost

        test:
          database: <%= "dtr_test_#{ENV['RUNNER_NAME']}" %>
          adapter: mysql
          username: root
          password: 
          host: localhost
        

=== TBD for next release
  should trigger started notification on test runner in agent Herald, for some tools are using this hook(e.g. inbrowser_test) to setup test environment.
  agent should wakeup when worker is dead, so that it could be picked up by another master process
  provide a way to monitor agent runner efficiency
  use system instead of fork to launch sub process in agent, which makes dtr support windows and jruby
